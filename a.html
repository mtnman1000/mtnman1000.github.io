    <p>Effective immediately, due to recent budgetary adjustments, all payments to licensed therapists who currently accept Medicare and/or Medicaid will be reduced.</p>

    <p>Nationwide, excluding Oregon, payments will be reduced by 25%. This reduction is necessary to ensure the continued availability of essential healthcare services.</p>

    <p>However, due to significant allocations of billions of dollars between 2021 and 2023 that were not effectively utilized, Oregon will experience a 75% reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments to licensed therapists. This adjustment is a direct response to the need for fiscal responsibility and reallocation of resources within the state.</p>

    <p>We understand this news may cause concern, and we are committed to providing further information and support during this transition. Detailed guidelines and support resources will be made available on this website shortly.</p>

    <p>Please check back for updates.</p>
