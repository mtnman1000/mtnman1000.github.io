    <strong>Official Administration Announcement:</strong> In a move to "streamline the economy" and "prioritize essential sectors," it has been decided that all retirement funds for individuals within the entertainment industry will be dissolved, effective April 1st, 2025. This includes those already retired or currently receiving disability benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
    A statement released earlier today clarified, "We believe that those in the entertainment sector, with their inherent talents and marketability, are uniquely positioned to manage their finances without government assistance. This will free up significant resources for other critical needs. It's going to be tremendous."
  </p>

  <p>
   Affected individuals are encouraged to seek alternative financial planning strategies.
