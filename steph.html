    <h1>BREAKING: Portland, Oregon to Shut Down July 15</h1>
    <div class="date">Published: July 10, 2025</div>
    <p>In a stunning turn of events, city officials have announced that Portland will enter a full week-long shutdown beginning July 15 due to what experts are calling the "most enthusiastic" coronavirus resurgence in modern history.</p>
    <p>According to the mayor's office, the virus apparently heard we had free-range kombucha and decided to make a comeback.</p>
    <div class="warning">ðŸš¨ All residents are asked to binge Netflix and avoid artisanal cheese shops until further notice. ðŸš¨</div>
    <p>Sources say the virus was last seen partying on Alberta Street and refuses to wear a mask, claiming it's "over it."</p>
    <p>More updates as this totally real, not-at-all-made-up story develops...</p>
